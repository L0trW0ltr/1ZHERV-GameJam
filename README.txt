Controls:

	W,A,S,D keys for movement
	E key for interaction with items/allies
	Some windows are passable (you can walk through them, you will figure it out.. :))

Everything is made by me (music, sprites, code), but the only thing that i didn't create was 
NavMeshPlus (https://github.com/h8man/NavMeshPlus). It helped me with pathfinding of the enemies.
